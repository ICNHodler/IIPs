<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged IIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new IIPs. Note that an IIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your IIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `iip-title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Description
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the IIP.-->
Hold an event every quarter to celebrate the burning of tokens as part of the repayment / buyback programme. 

## Motivation
<!-- The motivation should clearly explain why the existing system is inadequate to address the problem that the IIP solves. -->
ICN's value is derived primarily from buybacks and the quarterly burns are something every ICN hodler looks forward to. Currently, the amount of tokens to be burned is announced as part of quarterly reports however the actual token burn event time is seemingly random / unknown. 

If there were a dedicated burning ritual / ceremony / event celebrating the burning of tokens, it would generate buzz within the community and also help to promote and explain buybacks to people who may not quite understand their importance or realise how they add value to ICN.  

The event could be something as simple as a pre-announced live youtube stream from Iconomi offices or it could be conducted as part of a conference or meet the managers event. 

An etherscan page with burn address could be open on screen, with maybe a countdown timer to the event. Everything for the transaction could be set up in advance so all someone has to do is press a button for transaction to be confirmed. This could be a staff member, a mascott, an audience member, a robot... 

## Research
<!--Showing test cases, examples or research of how and why the idea has worked before (in other projects or other walks of life) will help strengthen the case for the IIP.-->
Buybacks / burns are something a lot of people don't fully understand and appreciate. Vitalik has said in the past that this is the best way to give tokens value:

> The important thing is that for the token to have a stable value, it is highly beneficial for the token supply to have sinks - places where tokens actually disappear and so the total token quantity decreases over time. [source](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/10/17/moe.html)

The CEO of binance also recently said "I also learned a shocking amount of people still donâ€™t understand the concept of "burn". Simply speaking, if someone destroys 10% of a currency (burn), that achieves the exact financial effect as spreading that 10% proportionally to the other 90% holders (usually called a dividend distribution). Some people seems to be (wrongly) happier with a dividend distribution than a burn, for no logical reason." [source](https://medium.com/binanceexchange/binance-q4-recap-80c1948ce123)

Burning tokens is something that Vitalik & CZ feel the need to explain / justify in order to educate people on why it makes sense so what better way for Iconomi to do that by doing it live and making it a fun, once-a-quarter event which can be cited and referenced by anyone when talking about this model in the future.
