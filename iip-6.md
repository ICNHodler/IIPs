## Description
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the IIP.-->
As part of the ICONOMI 2018 roadmap, a major upgrade for user statistics is planned. ICONOMI have made some progress already with this.

>The first phase of this upgrade has been implemented: full price history with charting is now available, as well as several additional indicators.  
[Source.](https://medium.com/iconominet/development-overview-q2-2018-fd11fc14388b)

These upgrades have made it easier for users to assess the performance of individual DAAs on the platform. So far there has not been a corresponding upgrade to a user's aggregate performance page, under the portfolio tab of the platform.

This IIP proposes providing the user with more powerful and varied tools to assess their equity performance. Specifically, adding BTC, ETH and EUR as a tracking mechanism for current and historic portfolio value.


## Motivation
<!-- The motivation should clearly explain why the existing system is inadequate to address the problem that the IIP solves. -->

##### Currently, a user can find the following information on their equity performance once logged into the ICONOMI platform:
Current Portfolio total value in USD.
Individual DAA holding profit/loss taken, current, and all time, in USD or percentage.
Current Individual Digital Asset value in USD.
Current aggregate Digital Assets value and aggregate DAA values in USD.

##### A user can not compare any of these statistics or values against either BTC, ETH, or EUR on the platform.

*This IIP proposes that adding these tracking mechanisms to the platform will benefit the users and also the platform.*


## Research
<!--Showing test cases, examples or research of how and why the idea has worked before (in other projects or other walks of life) will help strengthen the case for the IIP.-->
Having consulted with other members in the ICONOMI rocket.chat, there is general community support for these suggestions to be implemented on the ICONOMI platform. 


##### Note: 
Miha, ICONOMIâ€™s CTO, commented that the implementation of this feature is not yet in progress, and may be somewhat complex to get right. This feature may be added in the future, but is not part of any definite plan.
