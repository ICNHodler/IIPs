# What are IIPs?
ICONOMI Improvement Proposals (IIPs) describe ideas from the ICONOMI community on how ICONOMI (the digital assets management platform) can improve. All IIPs follow a standard format which help to structure ideas and ensure a minimum level of thought / effort has been put in to them. 

IIPs are in no way affiliated with nor endorsed by ICONOMI - they're a community initiative and therefore IIPs aren't guaranteed to be acted upon in any way by ICONOMI. The primary purpose of IIPs is to harness the power of the ICONOMI community by enabling the community to document their own ideas which they believe could improve ICONOMI. These ideas, all stored in the one place and in the same format, can then easily be referenced, refined and debated over time by the author, by the community and/or with ICONOMI themselves.
