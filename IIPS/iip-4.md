## Description
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the IIP.-->
A board of directors (B of D) is a group of individuals, elected to represent shareholders. A board's mandate is to establish policies for corporate management and oversight, making decisions on major company issues. ICONOMI should establish a board of directors that is elected from the ICN token holders to lead operations for all things ICONOMI.

## Motivation
<!-- The motivation should clearly explain why the existing system is inadequate to address the problem that the IIP solves. -->
Currently ICONOMI operates under their own supervision. ICN tokens are meant to represent ownership in all underlying assets which ICONOMI is currently managing. ICONOMI is a service provider. ICONOMI does not have true accountability to its shareholders, since its shareholders are not represented on any board that oversees pivotal company decisions.
Establishing a board of directors will ensure accountability by senior ICONOMI staff to meet their fiduciary obligation to their shareholders.


## Research
<!--Showing test cases, examples or research of how and why the idea has worked before (in other projects or other walks of life) will help strengthen the case for the IIP.-->
It is legal precedent in every first world jurisdiction that a publicly traded company has a board of directors that is elected by the shareholders. ICONOMI has stated that ICN tokens represent full ownership of all IP and assets. ICONOMI is a next generation publicly traded company and as such, following this old world standard will help ICONOMI as it attempts to grow in a fully regulated environment.
