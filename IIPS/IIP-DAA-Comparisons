## Description
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the IIP.-->
As part of the ICONOMI 2018 roadmap, a major upgrade for user statistics is planned. ICONOMI have made some progress already with this.

>The first phase of this upgrade has been implemented: full price history with charting is now available, as well as several additional indicators.  
[Source.](https://medium.com/iconominet/development-overview-q2-2018-fd11fc14388b)

These upgrades have made it easier for users to assess the performance of individual DAAs on the platform. 

This IIP proposes providing the user with more powerful and varied tools to compare DAA performance. Specifically allowing a user to compare the historic performance of a DAA with BTC and ETH.



## Motivation
<!-- The motivation should clearly explain why the existing system is inadequate to address the problem that the IIP solves. -->

### Charting and Comparison Tools
On the 'Compare' tab on the ICONOMI platform, it is possible to compare any two DAAs with each other. It is not however possible to compare a DAA with an individual Digital Asset, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. It may be an effective tool both for existing and prospective users to easily access this information. Additionally, as this page is available without being logged into the platform, it would aid in creating a compelling pitch to new investors.
If a DAA is consistently outperforming BTC/ETH over time, that should be shouted from the rooftops and used to explain the value and importance of diversification. If a DAA is consistently under-performing the market, then both potential investors and the DAA manager should be aware of that. Several DAA managers specifically say that their goal is to outperform the market - but right now neither they nor the community have an easy way of measuring performance and seeing whether they're achieving that goal or not.

*This IIP proposes that the additional functionality of comparing DAAs to BTC and ETH will be a valuable feature for the platform and for its users.*



## Research
<!--Showing test cases, examples or research of how and why the idea has worked before (in other projects or other walks of life) will help strengthen the case for the IIP.-->
Having consulted with other members in the ICONOMI rocket.chat, there is general community support for these suggestions to be implemented on the ICONOMI platform. 


##### Note: 
Miha, ICONOMIâ€™s CTO, commented that few site users use the compare feature, and so they consider other features to be of a higher priority. This feature may be added in the future, but is not part of any definite plan.
