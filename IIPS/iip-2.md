## Description
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the IIP.-->
As part of the ICONOMI 2018 roadmap, a major upgrade for user statistics is planned. ICONOMI have made some progress already with this.

>The first phase of this upgrade has been implemented: full price history with charting is now available, as well as several additional indicators.  
[Source.](https://medium.com/iconominet/development-overview-q2-2018-fd11fc14388b)

These upgrades have made it easier for users to assess the performance of individual DAAs on the platform. So far there has not been a corresponding upgrade to a user's aggregate performance page, under the portfolio tab of the platform.

This IIP proposes unifying reported equity performance information and additionally providing the user with more powerful and varied tools to assess their equity performance. Specifically, providing information on the platform about the historic performance of the user’s entire portfolio.



## Motivation
<!-- The motivation should clearly explain why the existing system is inadequate to address the problem that the IIP solves. -->

### Information disparity
ICONOMI provide a variety of information about performance of an individual investor's equity. The majority of this 'floats' through time with the user, for example the 3 month performance of a DAA. Some information on all-time performance of individual DAAs is available.

However, not all information is available for all holdings on the platform - most notably the lack of any performance information on digital assets held outside of DAAs, and the lack of historic performance information for the investor's portfolio as a whole.


##### Currently, a user can find the following information on their equity performance once logged into the ICONOMI platform:
Current Portfolio total value - available on most pages.
Current aggregate Digital Assets value and aggregate DAA values - available on portfolio page.
Individual DAA holding $/% profit/loss taken, current, and all time - available on individual DAA dashboard page.
Current Individual Digital Asset value - available on portfolio page.

##### A user can not find:
Historic portfolio total value.
Historic individual Digital Asset value.
Historic aggregate Digital Assets value and aggregate DAA values.
Historic total portfolio $/% profit/loss taken.

*This IIP proposes that the features that cannot be found currently by users are of value to investors, and so to the platform, and ought to be made easily discoverable to users.*



## Research
<!--Showing test cases, examples or research of how and why the idea has worked before (in other projects or other walks of life) will help strengthen the case for the IIP.-->
Having consulted with other members in the ICONOMI rocket.chat, there is general community support for these suggestions to be implemented on the ICONOMI platform. 


##### Note: 
Miha, ICONOMI’s CTO, has confirmed that at least some of the features in this IIP are intended to be implemented by ICONOMI as part of the general 2018 roadmap.
