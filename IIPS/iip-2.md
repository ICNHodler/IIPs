## Description
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the IIP.-->
As part of the ICONOMI 2018 roadmap, a major upgrade for user statistics is planned. ICONOMI have made some progress already with this.

>The first phase of this upgrade has been implemented: full price history with charting is now available, as well as several additional indicators.  
[Source.](https://medium.com/iconominet/development-overview-q2-2018-fd11fc14388b)

These upgrades have made it easier for users to assess the performance of the performance of individual DAAs on the platform. So far there has not been a corresponding upgrade to a user's aggregate performance page, under the portfolio tab of the platform.

This IIP proposes unifying reported equity performance information and additionally providing the user with more powerful and varied tools to assess their equity performance, including comparing DAA performance at-a-glance with Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Additionally, and potentially separately, this IIP proposes providing a periodic performance report allowing an at-a-glance update of all of a user's funds held on the ICONOMI platform. 


## Motivation
<!-- The motivation should clearly explain why the existing system is inadequate to address the problem that the IIP solves. -->
### 1. Information disparity
ICONOMI provide a variety of information about performance of an individual investor's equity. The majority of this 'floats' through time with the user, for example the 3 month performance of a DAA. Some information on all-time performance of individual DAAs is available.

However, not all information is available for all holdings on the platform - most notably the lack of any performance information on digital assets held outside of DAAs, and the lack of historic performance information for the investor's portfolio as a whole.

##### Currently, a user can find the following information on their equity performance once logged into the ICONOMI platform:

Current Portfolio total value - available on most pages.  
Current aggregate Digital Asset and DAA values - available on portfolio page.  
Individual DAA holding $/% profit/loss taken, current, and all time - available on individual DAA dashboard page.  
Current Individual Digital Asset value - available on portfolio page.  

##### A user can not find:

Historic Portfolio total value.  
Historic aggregate Digital Asset and DAA values.  
Historic Individual DAA holding profit/loss taken, current, and all time as measured against digital assets, such as BTC or ETH, rather than dollars.  
Historic Total Portfolio $/% profit/loss taken, current, and all time, and also as measured against digital assets, such as BTC/ETH.  
Historic Individual Digital Asset value.  

*This IIP proposes that the features that cannot be found currently by users are of value to investors, and so to the platform, and ought to be made easily discoverable to users.*

### 2. Charting and Comparison Tools
On the 'Compare' tab on the ICONOMI platform, it is possible to compare any two DAAs with each other. It is not however possible to compare a DAA with an individual Digital Asset, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.
It may be an effective tool both for existing and prospective users to be able to easily access this information. Additionally, as this page is available without being logged into the platform, it would aid in creating a compelling pitch to new investors.


*This IIP proposes that the additional functionality of comparing DAAs to BTC and ETH will be a valuable feature for the platform and for its users.*

### 3. Annual Report
A periodic investor report is generally provided in the traditional fund management world, often annually or biannually. Adding a similar feature to ICONOMI would allow for easier user record/book-keeping.
However, if the features from 1. and 2. are implemented onto the platform, such a report would have minimal additional utility. 

## Research
<!--Showing test cases, examples or research of how and why the idea has worked before (in other projects or other walks of life) will help strengthen the case for the IIP.-->
There is extensive precedent of annual investment performance reporting. Additionally, an industry-standard framework is available at [the CFA Institute's GIPS site](https://www.gipsstandards.org/Pages/index.aspx). Compliance with this will entrench ICONOMI's commitment to high standards.
