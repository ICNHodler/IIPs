## Description
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the IIP.-->
This IIP proposes the introduction of an activity log of all DAA activity so that investors & prospective investors of DAAs along DAA managers can view a historical record of all changes made to the DAA. 

"Activity" could be defined initially as:
* changes to an assets percentage allocation within DAA
* new asset added to DAA
* asset removed from DAA
* changes to management fees
* changes to entry/exit fees 

## Motivation
<!-- The motivation should clearly explain why the existing system is inadequate to address the problem that the IIP solves. -->
At present, DAA managers and investors have no way of viewing how a DAA was structured in the past. They don't know when the DAA was last updated or even if it has been updated at all. Being able to see how often a DAA manager rebalances is important for investors to:
1. Determine how active/inactive DAA managers are 
2. Judge the decisions that have been made in the past, with the benefit of hindsight

For example if a DAA went to 50% TUSD in Jan 2018, we can say it was a smart move only with hindsight. If a DAA manager had done that, we now wouldn't have any way of knowing from looking at the DAA page. We'd probably notice a better ROI than other DAAs but we wouldn't know *why* that was the case. A DAA activity log would help explain. 

Investors may also be more inclined to trust a DAA manager in the future if they can view past rebalances. Currently, ROI data is the only way we can judge performance / history but over time that can paint a misleading picture of a DAA manager's decision making. If a DAA has performed poorly to date and decides to rebalance significantly and the DAA ends up outperforming other DAAs in the short term, that story won't be reflected in ROI figures and the DAA manager probably won't get the credit they deserve for making a bold decision.

## Research
<!--Showing test cases, examples or research of how and why the idea has worked before (in other projects or other walks of life) will help strengthen the case for the IIP.-->

Version control is an essential tool for developers as among other things it helps to create timestamped history and helps with accountability and traceability. 

Investors always want to feel more informed and providing them with a version-control-like system for DAAs would help them feel more informed, allow them to explore historical decisions (and judge the consequences) and it would also help to make DAA activity more transparent.
